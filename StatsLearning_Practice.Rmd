**Question 1**
Generate 30 equally spaced values of x between 0 and 5 using the seq command. For each x
value, calculate a y value obeying y = exp(x). Plot x against y using the plot command

```{r}
x = seq(from=0, to=5, length.out = 30)
y = exp(x)
plot(x, y, xlab='x', ylab='y')
```

**Question 2**
Generate 10000 uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 100 using the runif
command. Plot a histogram of these numbers with 80 bins using the hist command
```{r}
z = runif(n=10000, min = 0, max = 100)
hist(z, breaks = 80)
```

**Question 3**
Using a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 1, generate 100 Normally-distributed numbers
using the rnorm command. Find the sample mean and standard deviation of this generated
sample using the mean and sd commands.

```{r}
w = rnorm(n=100, mean=5, sd=1)
m = mean(w)
s = sd(w)
print(m)
print(s)
```
